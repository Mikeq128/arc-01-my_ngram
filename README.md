# Welcome to My Ngram
*My Ngram*

## Task
The task demanded an iterative approach, traversing each character within a string and performing frequency analysis. Leveraging my acquired skills from prior lessons, I devised and implemented an effective solution to accurately tally the occurrences of each element.

## Description
Applying the newly acquired skills from past lessons proved invaluable. My skillful navigation through the string, fueled by precise element counting algorithms, delivered the desired outcome - a flawless tally of each occurrence.

## Installation
To install the project, you can follow these steps:
